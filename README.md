# React-Redux-Project
Here is a great example of a typical Lambda School assignment. We did one of these each weekday while here with a few exceptions. In this one, I simply create a react app and demonstrate the ability to use redux on a basic level.



This project allowed me to practice the concepts and techniques learned in the redux module and apply them in a concrete project. This module explored asyncronous action creators in Redux. It is simply building an app from scratch that consumes an and displays data fetched from that API.
