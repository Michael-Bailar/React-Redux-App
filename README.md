# React-Redux-Project
Here is a great example of a typical Lambda School assignment. We did one of these each weekday while here with a few exceptions. In this one, I simply create a react app and demonstrate the ability to use redux on a basic level. It was super empowering to be able to pick this up so quick and get a real project up and running. It was so nice to be able to do these projects with version control which I got a lot better with over the course of Lambda School

This project allowed me to practice the concepts and techniques learned in the redux module and apply them in a concrete project. This module explored asyncronous action creators in Redux. It is simply building an app from scratch that consumes an and displays data fetched from that API.
